The base panda.urdf is taken directly from pyBullet's repository.
The joint limits as per robot spec are in the safetycontroller tag, but those are ignored by pyBullet.
It uses only the hard joint limits, which are 3-4 degrees more. We adjusted this so that the same joint limits
as in the safetycontroller are used as hard joint limits. This is in line with the robot spec as well.

The versions 166, 160, 150 are only distinguished by their joint range for joint 1 and 7.
